# TravelTide
Mastery Project Travel Tide
📂 TravelTide Rewards Program Project
Google Advanced Data Analytics Certificate – Final Project Submission

Analyst: Andrea Cigrovski

Date: July 2025

📋 Project Summary
This project supports TravelTide’s initiative to personalize its rewards program based on user behavior and preferences. Using behavioral, booking, and perk-interaction data, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, dimensionality reduction (PCA), clustering (K-Means, DBSCAN), and final perk assignment.

The final deliverables provide actionable insights and targeted perk recommendations to enhance customer engagement and retention.

📌 Project Structure Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – Identified travel trends, booking behaviors, and user interaction patterns

Feature Engineering – Created aggregated metrics per user (sessions, clicks, trip types, etc.)

Perk Validation – Filtered and verified perks with high booking conversion

Clustering – Grouped users into behavior-based clusters

Perk Assignment – Assigned best-fit perk based on cluster behavior and engagement

Recommendations – Proposed data-driven strategies to improve the rewards program
